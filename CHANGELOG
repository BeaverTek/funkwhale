0.18 "Naomi" (2019-01-22)
-------------------------

This release is dedicated to Naomi, an early contributor and beta tester of Funkwhale.
Her positivity, love and support have been incredibly helpful and helped shape the project
as you can enjoy it today. Thank you so much Naomi <3

Many thanks to the dozens of people that contributed to this release: translators, developers,
bug hunters, admins and backers. You made it possible!

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/index.html, ensure you also execute the intructions
marked with ``[manual action required]`` and ``[manual action suggested]``.

See ``Full changelog`` below for an exhaustive list of changes!

Audio transcoding is back!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After removal of our first, buggy transcoding implementation, we're proud to announce
that this feature is back. It is enabled by default, and can be configured/disabled
in your instance settings!

This feature works in the browser, with federated/non-federated tracks and using Subsonic clients.
Transcoded tracks are generated on the fly, and cached for a configurable amount of time,
to reduce the load on the server.


Licensing and copyright information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale is now able to parse copyright and license data from file and store
this information. Apart from displaying it on each track detail page,
no additional behaviour is currently implemented to use this new data, but this
will change in future releases.

License and copyright data is also broadcasted over federation.

License matching is done on the content of the ``License`` tag in the files,
with a fallback on the ``Copyright`` tag.

Funkwhale will successfully extract licensing data for the following licenses:

- Creative Commons 0 (Public Domain)
- Creative Commons 1.0 (All declinations)
- Creative Commons 2.0 (All declinations)
- Creative Commons 2.5 (All declinations and countries)
- Creative Commons 3.0 (All declinations and countries)
- Creative Commons 4.0 (All declinations)

Support for other licenses such as Art Libre or WTFPL will be added in future releases.


Instance-level moderation tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes a first set of moderation tools that will give more control
to admins about the way their instance federates with other instance and accounts on the network.
Using these tools, it's now possible to:

- Browse known accounts and domains, and associated data (storage size, software version, etc.)
- Purge data belonging to given accounts and domains
- Block or partially restrict interactions with any account or domain

All those features are usable using a brand new "moderation" permission, meaning
you can appoint one or multiple moderators to help with this task.

I'd like to thank all Mastodon contributors, because some of the these tools are heavily
inspired from what's being done in Mastodon. Thank you so much!


Iframe widget to embed public tracks and albums [manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale now support embedding a lightweight audio player on external websites
for album and tracks that are available in public libraries. Important pages,
such as artist, album and track pages also include OpenGraph tags that will
enable previews on compatible apps (like sharing a Funkwhale track link on Mastodon
or Twitter).

To achieve that, we had to tweak the way Funkwhale front-end is served. You'll have
to modify your nginx configuration when upgrading to keep your instance working.

**On docker setups**, edit your ``/srv/funkwhale/nginx/funkwhale.template`` and replace
the ``location /api/`` and `location /` blocks by the following snippets::

    location / {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this is needed if you have file import via upload enabled
        client_max_body_size ${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE};
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/;
    }

    location /front/ {
        alias /frontend/;
    }

The change of configuration will be picked when restarting your nginx container.

**On non-docker setups**, edit your ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/funkwhale.conf`` file,
and replace the ``location /api/`` and `location /` blocks by the following snippets::


    location / {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this is needed if you have file import via upload enabled
        client_max_body_size ${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE};
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/;
    }

    location /front/ {
        alias ${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}/;
    }

Replace ``${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}`` by the corresponding variable from your .env file,
which should be ``/srv/funkwhale/front/dist`` by default, then reload your nginx process with
``sudo systemctl reload nginx``.


Alternative docker deployment method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks to the awesome done by @thetarkus at https://github.com/thetarkus/docker-funkwhale,
we're now able to provide an alternative and easier Docker deployment method!

In contrast with our current, multi-container offer, this method integrates
all Funkwhale processes and services (database, redis, etc.) into a single, easier to deploy container.

Both method will coexist in parallel, as each one has pros and cons. You can learn more
about this exciting new deployment option by visiting https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/docker.html!

Automatically load .env file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On non-docker deployments, earlier versions required you to source
the config/.env file before launching any Funkwhale command, with ``export $(cat config/.env | grep -v ^# | xargs)``
This led to more complex and error prode deployment / setup.

This is not the case anymore, and Funkwhale will automatically load this file if it's available.


Delete pre 0.17 federated tracks [manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you were using Funkwhale before the 0.17 release and federated with other instances,
it's possible that you still have some unplayable federated files in the database.

To purge the database of those entries, you can run the following command:

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script delete_pre_017_federated_uploads --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script delete_pre_017_federated_uploads --no-input


Enable gzip compression [manual action suggested]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Gzip compression will be enabled on new instances by default
and will reduce the amount of bandwidth consumed by your instance.

If you want to benefit from gzip compression on your instance,
edit your reverse proxy virtualhost file (located at ``/etc/nginx/sites-available/funkwhale.conf``) and add the following snippet
in the server block, then reload your nginx server::

    server {
        # ... exiting configuration

        # compression settings
        gzip on;
        gzip_comp_level    5;
        gzip_min_length    256;
        gzip_proxied       any;
        gzip_vary          on;

        gzip_types
            application/atom+xml
            application/javascript
            application/json
            application/ld+json
            application/activity+json
            application/manifest+json
            application/rss+xml
            application/vnd.geo+json
            application/vnd.ms-fontobject
            application/x-font-ttf
            application/x-web-app-manifest+json
            application/xhtml+xml
            application/xml
            font/opentype
            image/bmp
            image/svg+xml
            image/x-icon
            text/cache-manifest

Using a LDAP directory to authenticate to your Funkwhale instance
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale now support LDAP as an authentication source: you can configure
your instance to delegate login to a LDAP directory, which is especially
useful when you have an existing directory and don't want to manage users
manually.

You can use this authentication backend side by side with the classic one.

Have a look at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/ldap.html
for detailed instructions on how to set this up.


Simplified nginx setup [Docker: Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We've received a lot of user feedback regarding our installation process,
and it seems the proxy part is the one which is the most confusing and difficult.
Unfortunately, this is also the one where errors and mistakes can completely break
the application.

To make things easier for everyone, we now offer a simplified deployment
process for the reverse proxy part. This will make upgrade of the proxy configuration
significantly easier on docker deployments.

On non-docker instances, you have nothing to do.

If you have a dockerized instance, here is the upgrade path.

First, tweak your .env file::

    # remove the FUNKWHALE_URL variable
    # and add the next variables
    FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME=yourdomain.funkwhale
    FUNKWHALE_PROTOCOL=https

    # add the following variable, matching the path your app is deployed
    # leaving the default should work fine if you deployed using the same
    # paths as the documentation
    FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/front/dist

Then, add the following block at the end of your docker-compose.yml file::

    # existing services
    api:
        ...
    celeryworker:
        ...

    # new service
    nginx:
      image: nginx
      env_file:
        - .env
      environment:
        # Override those variables in your .env file if needed
        - "NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE=${NGINX_MAX_BODY_SIZE-100M}"
      volumes:
        - "./nginx/funkwhale.template:/etc/nginx/conf.d/funkwhale.template:ro"
        - "./nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf:/etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf:ro"
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH-/srv/funkwhale/data/music}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH-/srv/funkwhale/data/music}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}:ro"
        - "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}:ro"
        - "${FUNKWHALE_FRONTEND_PATH}:/frontend:ro"
      ports:
        # override those variables in your .env file if needed
        - "${FUNKWHALE_API_IP}:${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT}:80"
      command: >
          sh -c "envsubst \"`env | awk -F = '{printf \" $$%s\", $$1}'`\"
          < /etc/nginx/conf.d/funkwhale.template
          > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
          && cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
          && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
      links:
        - api

By doing that, you'll enable a dockerized nginx that will automatically be
configured to serve your Funkwhale instance.

Download the required configuration files for the nginx container:

.. parsed-literal::

    cd /srv/funkwhale
    mkdir nginx
    curl -L -o nginx/funkwhale.template "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/|version|/deploy/docker.nginx.template"
    curl -L -o nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/|version|/deploy/funkwhale_proxy.conf"

Update the funkwhale.conf configuration of your server's reverse-proxy::

    # the file should match something like that, upgrade all variables
    # between ${} to match the ones in your .env file,
    # and your SSL configuration if you're not using let's encrypt
    # The important thing is that you only have a single location block
    # that proxies everything to your dockerized nginx.

    sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/funkwhale.conf
    upstream fw {
        # depending on your setup, you may want to update this
        server ${FUNKWHALE_API_IP}:${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT};
    }
    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name ${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME};
        location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }
    }
    server {
        listen      443 ssl;
        listen [::]:443 ssl;
        server_name ${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME};

        # TLS
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2;
        ssl_ciphers HIGH:!MEDIUM:!LOW:!aNULL:!NULL:!SHA;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_certificate     /etc/letsencrypt/live/${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME}/fullchain.pem;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/${FUNKWHALE_HOSTNAME}/privkey.pem;

        # HSTS
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000";

        location / {
            include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
            proxy_pass   http://fw/;
        }
    }

Check that your configuration is valid then reload:

    sudo nginx -t
    sudo systemctl reload nginx

Library home and playlist page overhaul
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library home page have been completely redesigned to include:

- other users activity (listenings, playlists and favorites)
- recently imported albums

We think this new version showcases more music in a more useful way, let us know
what you think about it!

The playlist page have been updated as well.


Internationalized interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After months of work, we're proud to announce our interface is now ready
for internationalization.

Translators have already started the work of translating Funkwhale in 8 different languages,
and we're ready to add more as needed.

You can easily get involved at https://translate.funkwhale.audio/engage/funkwhale/


Better handling of tracks with a different artist than the album artist
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some tracks involve a different artist than the album artist (e.g. a featuring)
and Funkwhale has been known to do weird things when importing such tracks, resulting
in albums that contained a single track, for instance.

The situation should be improved with this release, as Funkwhale is now able to
store separately the track and album artist, and display it properly in the interface.


Users now have an ActivityPub Actor [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the process of implementing federation for user activity such as listening
history, we are now making user profiles (a.k.a. ActivityPub actors) available through federation.

This does not means the federation is working, but this is a needed step to implement it.

Those profiles will be created automatically for new users, but you have to run a command
to create them for existing users.

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script create_actors --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script create_actors --no-input

This should only take a few seconds to run. It is safe to interrupt the process or rerun it multiple times.


Image thumbnails [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To reduce bandwidth usage on slow or limited connexions and improve performance
in general, we now use smaller images in the front-end. For instance, if you have
an album cover with a 1000x1000 pixel size, we will create smaller
versions of this image (50x50, 200x200, 400x400) and reference those resized version
when we don't actually need the original image.

Thumbnail will be created automatically for new objects, however, you have
to launch a manual command to deal with existing ones.

On docker setups::

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script create_image_variations --no-input

On non-docker setups::

    python manage.py script create_image_variations --no-input

This should be quite fast but may take up to a few minutes depending on the number
of albums you have in database. It is safe to interrupt the process or rerun it multiple times.


Improved search on federated tracks list
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Having a powerful but easy-to-use search is important but difficult to achieve, especially
if you do not want to have a real complex search interface.

Github does a pretty good job with that, using a structured but simple query system
(See https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/#search-only-issues-or-pull-requests).

This release implements a limited but working subset of this query system. You can use it only on the federated
tracks list (/manage/federation/tracks) at the moment, but depending on feedback it will be rolled-out on other pages as well.

This is the type of query you can run:

- ``hello world``: search for "hello" and "world" in all the available fields
- ``hello in:artist`` search for results where artist name is "hello"
- ``spring in:artist,album`` search for results where artist name or album title contain "spring"
- ``artist:hello`` search for results where artist name equals "hello"
- ``artist:"System of a Down" domain:instance.funkwhale`` search for results where artist name equals "System of a Down" and inside "instance.funkwhale" library


Ensure MEDIA_ROOT, STATIC_ROOT and MUSIC_DIRECTORY_* are set explicitely [Manual action required]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In our default .env file, MEDIA_ROOT and STATIC_ROOT were commented by default, causing
some deployment issues on non-docker setups when people forgot to uncomment them.

From now on, those variables are uncommented, and will also be used on docker setups
to mount the volumes automatically in the docker-compose.yml file. This has been a source
of headache as well in some deployments, where you had to update both the .env file and
the compose file.

This also applies to in-place paths (MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH and MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH),
whose values are now used directly to set up the proper Docker volumes.

This will only affect new deployments though. If you want to benefit from this on an
existing instance, do a backup of your ``.env`` and ``docker-compose.yml`` files and apply the following changes:

- Ensure ``MEDIA_ROOT`` is uncommented in your .env file and match the absolute path where media files are stored
  on your host (``/srv/funkwhale/data/media`` by default)
- Ensure ``STATIC_ROOT`` is uncommented in your .env file and match the absolute path where static files are stored
  on your host (``/srv/funkwhale/data/static`` by default)
- If you use in-place import:
    - Ensure MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH is uncommented and set to ``/music``
    - Ensure MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH is uncommented and set to the absolute path on your host were your music files
      are stored (``/srv/funkwhale/data/music`` by default)
- Edit your docker-compose.yml file to reflect the changes:
    - Search for volumes (there should be two occurences) that contains ``/app/funkwhale_api/media`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"``
    - Search for a volume that contains ``/app/staticfiles`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}"``
    - If you use in-place import, search for volumes (there should be two occurences) that contains ``/music:ro`` on the right side, and
      replace the whole line with ``- "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"``

In the end, the ``volumes`` directives of your containers should look like that::

    ...
    celeryworker
      volumes:
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"
    ...
    api:
      volumes:
        - "${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH}:${MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH}:ro"
        - "${MEDIA_ROOT}:${MEDIA_ROOT}"
        - "${STATIC_ROOT}:${STATIC_ROOT}"
        - ./front/dist:/frontend
    ...


Removed Cacheops dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We removed one of our dependency named django-cacheops. It was unly used in a few places,
and not playing nice with other dependencies.

You can safely remove this dependency in your environment with ``pip uninstall django-cacheops`` if you're
not using docker.

You can also safely remove any ``CACHEOPS_ENABLED`` setting from your environment file.

- Upgrade documentation now use the correct user on non-docker setups (#265)


Invite system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On closed instances, it has always been a little bit painful to create accounts
by hand for new users. This release solve that by adding invitations.

You can generate invitation codes via the "users" admin interface (you'll find a
link in the sidebar). Those codes are valid for 14 days, and can be used once
to create a new account on the instance, even if registrations are closed.

By default, we generate a random code for invitations, but you can also use custom codes
if you need to print them or make them fancier ;)

Invitations generation and management requires the "settings" permission.


Removed front-end and back-end coupling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Eventhough Funkwhale's front-end has always been a Single Page Application,
talking to an API, it was only able to talk to an API on the same domain.

There was no real technical justification behind this (only lazyness), and it was
also blocking interesting use cases:

- Use multiple customized versions of the front-end with the same instance
- Use a customized version of the front-end with multiple instances
- Use a locally hosted front-end with a remote API, which is especially useful in development

From now on, Funkwhale's front-end can connect to any Funkwhale server. You can
change the server you are connecting to in the footer.

Fixing this also unlocked a really interesting feature in our development/review workflow:
by leveraging Gitlab CI and review apps, we are now able to deploy automatically live versions of
a merge request, making it possible for anyone to review front-end changes easily, without
the need to install a local environment.


0.14.2 (2018-06-16)
-------------------

.. warning::

    This release contains a fix for a permission issue. You should upgrade
    as soon as possible. Read the changelog below for more details.

Upgrade instructions are available at
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Enhancements:

- Added feedback on shuffle button (#262)
- Added multiple warnings in the documentation that you should never run
  makemigrations yourself (#291)

Permission issues on radios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of an error in the way we checked user permissions on radios,
public radios could be deleted by any logged-in user, even if they were not
the owner of the radio.

We recommend instances owners to upgrade as fast as possible to avoid any abuse
and data loss.


Funkwhale is now licenced under AGPL-3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Following the recent switch made by PixelFed
(https://github.com/dansup/pixelfed/issues/143), we decided along with
the community to relicence Funkwhale under the AGPL-3 licence. We did this
switch for various reasons:

- This is better aligned with other fediverse software
- It prohibits anyone to distribute closed-source and proprietary forks of Funkwhale

As end users and instance owners, this does not change anything. You can
continue to use Funkwhale exactly as you did before :)


Apache support for websocket
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Up until now, our Apache2 configuration was not working with websockets. This is now
solved by adding this at the beginning of your Apache2 configuration file::

    Define funkwhale-api-ws ws://localhost:5000

And this, before the "/api" block::

    # Activating WebSockets
    ProxyPass "/api/v1/instance/activity" ${funkwhale-api-ws}/api/v1/instance/activity

Websockets may not be supported in older versions of Apache2. Be sure to upgrade to the latest version available.


Serving album covers in https (Apache2 proxy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two issues are addressed here. The first one was about Django replying with
mixed content (http) when queried for covers. Setting up the `X-Forwarded-Proto`
allows Django to know that the client is using https, and that the reply must
be https as well.

Second issue was a problem of permission causing Apache a denied access to
album cover folder. It is solved by adding another block for this path in
the Apache configuration file for funkwhale.

Here is how to modify your `funkwhale.conf` apache2 configuration::

  <VirtualHost *:443>

    ...
    #Add this new line
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    ...
    # Add this new block below the other <Directory/> blocks
    # replace /srv/funkwhale/data/media with the path to your media directory
    # if you're not using the standard layout.
    <Directory /srv/funkwhale/data/media/albums>
      Options FollowSymLinks
      AllowOverride None
      Require all granted
    </Directory>
    ...
  </VirtualHost>


About the makemigrations warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may sometimes get the following warning while applying migrations::

    "Your models have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied."

This is a warning, not an error, and it can be safely ignored.
Never run the ``makemigrations`` command yourself.

Removed alpha-state transcoding (#271)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A few months ago, a basic transcoding feature was implemented. Due to the way
this feature was designed, it was slow, CPU intensive on the server side,
and very tightly coupled to the reverse-proxy configuration, preventing
it to work Apache2, for instance. It was also not compatible with Subsonic clients.

Based on that, we're currently removing support for transcoding
**in its current state**. The work on a better designed transcoding feature
can be tracked in https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/issues/272.

You don't have to do anything on your side, but you may want to remove
the now obsolete configuration from your reverse proxy file (nginx only)::

    # Remove those blocks:

    # transcode cache
    proxy_cache_path /tmp/funkwhale-transcode levels=1:2 keys_zone=transcode:10m max_size=1g inactive=7d;

    # Transcoding logic and caching
    location = /transcode-auth {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # needed so we can authenticate transcode requests, but still
        # cache the result
        internal;
        set $query '';
        # ensure we actually pass the jwt to the underlytin auth url
        if ($request_uri ~* "[^\?]+\?(.*)$") {
            set $query $1;
        }
        proxy_pass http://funkwhale-api/api/v1/trackfiles/viewable/?$query;
        proxy_pass_request_body off;
        proxy_set_header        Content-Length "";
    }

    location /api/v1/trackfiles/transcode/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        # this block deals with authenticating and caching transcoding
        # requests. Caching is heavily recommended as transcoding
        # is a CPU intensive process.
        auth_request /transcode-auth;
        if ($args ~ (.*)jwt=[^&]*(.*)) {
            set $cleaned_args $1$2;
        }
        proxy_cache_key "$scheme$request_method$host$uri$is_args$cleaned_args";
        proxy_cache transcode;
        proxy_cache_valid 200 7d;
        proxy_ignore_headers "Set-Cookie";
        proxy_hide_header "Set-Cookie";
        add_header X-Cache-Status $upstream_cache_status;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api;
    }
    # end of transcoding logic

Files management interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first bit of an ongoing work that will span several releases, to
bring more powerful library management features to Funkwhale. This iteration
includes a basic file management interface where users with the "library"
permission can list and search available files, order them using
various criterias (size, bitrate, duration...) and delete them.

New "upload" permission
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This new permission is helpful if you want to give upload/import rights
to some users, but don't want them to be able to manage the library as a whole:
although there are no controls yet for managing library in the fron-end,
subsequent release will introduce management interfaces for artists, files,
etc.

Because of that, users with the "library" permission will have much more power,
and will also be able to remove content from the platform. On the other hand,
users with the "upload" permission will only have the ability to add new
content.

Also, this release also includes a new feature called "default permissions":
those are permissions that are granted to every users on the platform.
On public/open instances, this will play well with the "upload" permission
since everyone will be able to contribute to the instance library without
an admin giving the permission to every single user.

Smarter album cover importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In earlier versions, covers where only imported when launching a YouTube import.
Starting from this release, covers will be imported regardless of the import mode
(file upload, youtube-dl, CLI, in-place...). Funkwhale will look for covers
in the following order:

1. In the imported file itself (FLAC/MP3 only)
2. In a cover.jpg or cover.png in the file directory
3. By fetching cover art from Musibrainz, assuming the file is tagged correctly

This will only work for newly imported tracks and albums though. In the future,
we may offer an option to refetch album covers from the interface, but in the
meantime, you can use the following snippet:

.. code-block:: python

    # Store this in /tmp/update_albums.py
    from funkwhale_api.music.models import Album, TrackFile
    from funkwhale_api.music.tasks import update_album_cover

    albums_without_covers = Album.objects.filter(cover='')
    total = albums_without_covers.count()
    print('Found {} albums without cover'.format(total))
    for i, album in enumerate(albums_without_covers.iterator()):
        print('[{}/{}] Fetching cover for {}...'.format(i+1, total, album.title))
        f = TrackFile.objects.filter(track__album=album).filter(source__startswith='file://').first()
        update_album_cover(album, track_file=f)

Then launch it::

    # docker setups
    cat /tmp/update_albums.py | docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py shell -i python

    # non-docker setups
    source /srv/funkwhale/load_env
    source /srv/funkwhale/virtualenv/bin/activate
    cat /tmp/update_albums.py | python manage.py shell -i python

    # cleanup
    rm /tmp/update_albums.py

.. note::

    Depending on your number of albums, the previous snippet may take some time
    to execute. You can interrupt it at any time using ctrl-c and relaunch it later,
    as it's idempotent.

Music API changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes an API break. Even though the API is advertised
as unstable, and not documented, here is a brief explanation of the change in
case you are using the API in a client or in a script. Summary of the changes:

- ``/api/v1/artists`` does not includes a list of tracks anymore. It was to heavy
  to return all of this data all the time. You can get all tracks for an
  artist using ``/api/v1/tracks?artist=artist_id``
- Additionally, ``/api/v1/tracks`` now support an ``album`` filter to filter
  tracks matching an album
- ``/api/v1/artists/search``, ``/api/v1/albums/search`` and ``/api/v1/tracks/search``
  endpoints are removed. Use ``/api/v1/{artists|albums|tracks}/?q=yourquery``
  instead. It's also more powerful, since you can combine search with other
  filters and ordering options.
- ``/api/v1/requests/import-requests/search`` endpoint is removed as well.
  Use ``/api/v1/requests/import-requests/?q=yourquery``
  instead. It's also more powerful, since you can combine search with other
  filters and ordering options.

Of course, the front-end was updated to work with the new API, so this should
not impact end-users in any way, apart from slight performance gains.

.. note::

    The API is still not stable and may evolve again in the future. API freeze
    will come at a later point.

Flac files imports via upload
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have nothing to do to benefit from this, however, since Flac files
tend to be a lot bigger than other files, you may want to increase the
``client_max_body_size`` value in your Nginx configuration if you plan
to upload flac files.

Missing subsonic configuration bloc in vhost files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of a missing bloc in the sample Nginx and Apache configurations,
instances that were deployed after the 0.13 release are likely to be unable
to answer to Subsonic clients (the missing bits were properly documented
in the changelog).

Ensure you have the following snippets in your Nginx or Apache configuration
if you plan to use the Subsonic API.

Nginx::

    location /rest/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/api/subsonic/rest/;
    }

Apache2::

    <Location "/rest">
        ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
        ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
     </Location>


0.13 (2018-05-19)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
  https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Features:

- Can now import and play flac files (#157)
- Simpler permission system (#152)
- Store file length, size and bitrate (#195)
- We now have a brand new instance settings interface in the front-end (#206)


Enhancements:

- Disabled browsable HTML API in production (#205)
- Instances can now indicate on the nodeinfo endpoint if they want to remain
  private (#200)


Bugfixes:

- .well-known/nodeinfo endpoint can now answer to request with Accept:
  application/json (#197)
- Fixed escaping issue of track name in playlist modal (#201)
- Fixed missing dot when downloading file (#204)
- In-place imported tracks with non-ascii characters don't break reverse-proxy
  serving (#196)
- Removed Python 3.6 dependency (secrets module) (#198)
- Uplayable tracks are now properly disabled in the interface (#199)


Instance settings interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prior to this release, the only way to update instance settings (such as
instance description, signup policy, federation configuration, etc.) was using
the admin interface provided by Django (the back-end framework which power the API).

This interface worked, but was not really-user friendly and intuitive.

Starting from this release, we now offer a dedicated interface directly
in the front-end. You can view and edit all your instance settings from here,
assuming you have the required permissions.

This interface is available at ``/manage/settings` and via link in the sidebar.


Storage of bitrate, size and length in database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with this release, when importing files, Funkwhale will store
additional information about audio files:

- Bitrate
- Size (in bytes)
- Duration

This change is not retroactive, meaning already imported files will lack those
informations. The interface and API should work as before in such case, however,
we offer a command to deal with legacy files and populate the missing values.

On docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py fix_track_files


On non-docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    # from your activated virtualenv
    python manage.py fix_track_files

.. note::

    The execution time for this command is proportional to the number of
    audio files stored on your instance. This is because we need to read the
    files from disk to fetch the data. You can run it in the background
    while Funkwhale is up.

    It's also safe to interrupt this command and rerun it at a later point, or run
    it multiple times.

    Use the --dry-run flag to check how many files would be impacted.


Simpler permission system
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from this release, the permission system is much simpler. Up until now,
we were using Django's built-in permission system, which was working, but also
quite complex to deal with.

The new implementation relies on simpler logic, which will make integration
on the front-end in upcoming releases faster and easier.

If you have manually given permissions to users on your instance,
you can migrate those to the new system.

On docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    docker-compose run --rm api python manage.py script django_permissions_to_user_permissions --no-input

On non-docker setups:

.. code-block:: shell

    # in your virtualenv
    python api/manage.py script django_permissions_to_user_permissions --no-input

There is still no dedicated interface to manage user permissions, but you
can use the admin interface at ``/api/admin/users/user/`` for that purpose in
the meantime.


0.12 (2018-05-09)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at
  https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Features:

- Subsonic API implementation to offer compatibility with existing clients such
  as DSub (#75)
- Use nodeinfo standard for publishing instance information (#192)


Enhancements:

- Play button now play tracks immediately instead of appending them to the
  queue (#99, #156)


Bugfixes:

- Fix broken federated import (#193)


Documentation:

- Up-to-date documentation for upgrading front-end files on docker setup (#132)


Subsonic API
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release implements some core parts of the Subsonic API, which is widely
deployed in various projects and supported by numerous clients.

By offering this API in Funkwhale, we make it possible to access the instance
library and listen to the music without from existing Subsonic clients, and
without developping our own alternative clients for each and every platform.

Most advanced Subsonic clients support offline caching of music files,
playlist management and search, which makes them well-suited for nomadic use.

Please head over :doc:`users/apps` for more informations about supported clients
and user instructions.

At the instance-level, the Subsonic API is enabled by default, but require
and additional endpoint to be added in you reverse-proxy configuration.

On nginx, add the following block::

    location /rest/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/api/subsonic/rest/;
    }

On Apache, add the following block::

    <Location "/rest">
        ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
        ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/api/subsonic/rest
    </Location>

The Subsonic can be disabled at the instance level from the django admin.

.. note::

    Because of Subsonic's API design which assumes cleartext storing of
    user passwords, we chose to have a dedicated, separate password
    for that purpose. Users can generate this password from their
    settings page in the web client.


Nodeinfo standard for instance information and stats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    The ``/api/v1/instance/stats/`` endpoint which was used to display
    instance data in the about page is removed in favor of the new
    ``/api/v1/instance/nodeinfo/2.0/`` endpoint.

In earlier version, we where using a custom endpoint and format for
our instance information and statistics. While this was working,
this was not compatible with anything else on the fediverse.

We now offer a nodeinfo 2.0 endpoint which provides, in a single place,
all the instance information such as library and user activity statistics,
public instance settings (description, registration and federation status, etc.).

We offer two settings to manage nodeinfo in your Funkwhale instance:

1. One setting to completely disable nodeinfo, but this is not recommended
   as the exposed data may be needed to make some parts of the front-end
   work (especially the about page).
2. One setting to disable only usage and library statistics in the nodeinfo
   endpoint. This is useful if you want the nodeinfo endpoint to work,
   but don't feel comfortable sharing aggregated statistics about your library
   and user activity.

To make your instance fully compatible with the nodeinfo protocol, you need to
to edit your nginx configuration file::

    # before
    ...
    location /.well-known/webfinger {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/webfinger;
    }
    ...

    # after
    ...
    location /.well-known/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/;
    }
    ...

You can do the same if you use apache::

    # before
    ...
    <Location "/.well-known/webfinger">
      ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/webfinger
      ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/webfinger
    </Location>
    ...

    # after
    ...
    <Location "/.well-known/">
      ProxyPass ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/
      ProxyPassReverse ${funkwhale-api}/.well-known/
    </Location>
    ...

This will ensure all well-known endpoints are proxied to funkwhale, and
not just webfinger one.

0.11 (2018-05-06)
-----------------

Upgrade instructions are available at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html

Special thanks for this release go to @renon:matrix.org (@Hazmo on Gitlab)
for bringing Apache2 support to Funkwhale and contributing on other issues.
Thank you!

Features:

- Funkwhale now works behind an Apache2 reverse proxy (!165)
  check out the brand new documentation at https://docs.funkwhale.audio/installation/index.html#apache2
  if you want to try it!
- Users can now request password reset by email, assuming a SMTP server was
  correctly configured (#187)

Enhancements:

- Added a fix_track_files command to run checks and fixes against library
  (#183)
- Avoid fetching Actor object on every request authentication
- Can now relaunch errored jobs and batches (#176)
- List pending requests by default, added a status filter for requests (#109)
- More structured menus in sidebar, added labels with notifications
- Sample virtual-host file for Apache2 reverse-proxy (!165)
- Store high-level settings (such as federation or auth-related ones) in
  database (#186)


Bugfixes:

- Ensure in place imported files get a proper mimetype (#183)
- Federation cache suppression is now simpler and also deletes orphaned files
  (#189)
- Fixed small UI glitches/bugs in federation tabs (#184)
- X-sendfile not working with in place import (#182)


Documentation:

- Added a documentation area for third-party projects (#180)
- Added documentation for optimizing Funkwhale and reduce its memory footprint.
- Document that the database should use an utf-8 encoding (#185)
- Foundations for API documentation with Swagger (#178)


Database storage for high-level settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the work done in #186, the following environment variables have been
deprecated:

- FEDERATION_ENABLED
- FEDERATION_COLLECTION_PAGE_SIZE
- FEDERATION_MUSIC_NEEDS_APPROVAL
- FEDERATION_ACTOR_FETCH_DELAY
- PLAYLISTS_MAX_TRACKS
- API_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED

Configuration for this settings has been moved to database, as it will provide
a better user-experience, by allowing you to edit these values on-the-fly,
without restarting Funkwhale processes.

You can leave those environment variables in your .env file for now, as the
values will be used to populate the database entries. We'll make a proper
announcement when the variables won't be used anymore.

Please browse https://docs.funkwhale.audio/configuration.html#instance-settings
for more information about instance configuration using the web interface.


System emails
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from this release, Funkwhale will send two types
of emails:

- Email confirmation emails, to ensure a user's email is valid
- Password reset emails, enabling user to reset their password without an admin's intervention

Email sending is disabled by default, as it requires additional configuration.
In this mode, emails are simply outputed on stdout.

If you want to actually send those emails to your users, you should edit your
.env file and tweak the EMAIL_CONFIG variable. See :ref:`setting-EMAIL_CONFIG`
for more details.

.. note::

  As a result of these changes, the DJANGO_EMAIL_BACKEND variable,
  which was not documented, has no effect anymore. You can safely remove it from
  your .env file if it is set.


Proxy headers for non-docker deployments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For non-docker deployments, add ``--proxy-headers`` at the end of the ``daphne``
command in :file:`/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-server.service`.

This will ensure the application receive the correct IP address from the client
and not the proxy's one.

In-place import
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release includes in-place imports for the CLI import. This means you can
load gigabytes of music into funkwhale without worrying about about Funkwhale
copying those music files in its internal storage and eating your disk space.

`This new feature is documented here <https://docs.funkwhale.audio/importing-music.html#in-place-import>`_
and require additional configuration to ensure funkwhale and your webserver can
serve those files properly.

**Non-docker users:**

Assuming your music is stored in ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music``, add the following
block to your nginx configuration::

    location /_protected/music {
        internal;
        alias   /srv/funkwhale/data/music;
    }

And the following to your .env file::

    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/data/music

**Docker users:**

Assuming your music is stored in ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music``, add the following
block to your nginx configuration::

    location /_protected/music {
        internal;
        alias   /srv/funkwhale/data/music;
    }

Assuming you have the following volume directive in your ``docker-compose.yml``
(it's the default): ``/srv/funkwhale/data/music:/music:ro``, then add
the following to your .env file::

    # this is the path in the container
    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_PATH=/music
    # this is the path on the host
    MUSIC_DIRECTORY_SERVE_PATH=/srv/funkwhale/data/music


0.9.1 (2018-04-17)
------------------

Bugfixes:

- Allow null values for musicbrainz_id in Audio ActivityPub representation
- Fixed broken permission check on library scanning and too aggressive page
  validation


0.9 (2018-04-17)
----------------

Features:

- Add internationalization support (#5)
- Can now follow and import music from remote libraries (#136, #137)


Enhancements:

- Added a i18n-extract yarn script to extract strings to PO files (#162)
- User admin now includes signup and last login dates (#148)
- We now use a proper user agent including instance version and url during
  outgoing requests


Federation is here!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is for real this time, and includes:

- Following other Funkwhale libraries
- Importing tracks from remote libraries (tracks are hotlinked, and only cached for a short amount of time)
- Searching accross federated catalogs

Note that by default, federation is opt-in, on a per-instance basis:
instances will request access to your catalog, and you can accept or refuse
those requests. You can also revoke the access at any time.

Documentation was updated with relevant instructions to use and benefit
from this new feature: https://docs.funkwhale.audio/federation.html

Preparing internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Funkwhale's front-end as always been english-only, and this is a barrier
to new users. The work make Funkwhale's interface translatable was started
in this release by Baptiste. Although nothing is translated yet,
this release includes behind the stage changes that will make it possible in
the near future.

Many thank to Baptiste for the hard work and for figuring out a proper solution
to this difficult problem.

Upgrade path
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the usual instructions from
https://docs.funkwhale.audio/upgrading.html, non-docker users will have
to setup an additional systemd unit file for recurrent tasks.

This was forgotten in the deployment documentation, but recurrent tasks,
managed by the celery beat process, will be needed more and more in subsequent
releases. Right now, we'll be using to clear the cache for federated music files
and keep disk usage to a minimum.

In the future, they will also be needed to refetch music metadata or federated
information periodically.

Celery beat can be enabled easily::

    curl -L -o "/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-beat.service" "https://dev.funkwhale.audio/funkwhale/funkwhale/raw/develop/deploy/funkwhale-beat.service"
    # Also edit /etc/systemd/system/funkwhale.target
    # and ensure the Wants= line contains the following:
    # Wants=funkwhale-server.service funkwhale-worker.service funkwhale-beat.service
    nano /etc/systemd/system/funkwhale.target
    # reload configuration
    systemctl daemon-reload

Docker users already have celerybeat enabled.

Documentation:

- Documented the upgrade process (#127)


Preparing for federation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Federation of music libraries is one of the most asked feature.
While there is still a lot of work to do, this version includes
the foundation that will enable funkwhale servers to communicate
between each others, and with other federated software, such as
Mastodon.

Funkwhale will use ActivityPub as it's federation protocol.

In order to prepare for federation (see #136 and #137), new API endpoints
have been added under /federation and /.well-known/webfinger.

For these endpoints to work, you will need to update your nginx configuration,
and add the following snippets::

    location /federation/ {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/federation/;
    }

    location /.well-known/webfinger {
        include /etc/nginx/funkwhale_proxy.conf;
        proxy_pass   http://funkwhale-api/.well-known/webfinger;
    }

This will ensure federation endpoints will be reachable in the future.
You can of course skip this part if you know you will not federate your instance.

A new ``FEDERATION_ENABLED`` env var have also been added to control whether
federation is enabled or not on the application side. This settings defaults
to True, which should have no consequences at the moment, since actual
federation is not implemented and the only available endpoints are for
testing purposes.

Add ``FEDERATION_ENABLED=false`` to your .env file to disable federation
on the application side.

To test and troubleshoot federation, we've added a bot account. This bot is available at @test@yourinstancedomain,
and sending it "/ping", for example, via Mastodon, should trigger
a response.



0.7 (2018-03-21)
----------------

Features:

- Can now filter artists and albums with no listenable tracks (#114)
- Improve the style of the sidebar to make it easier to understand which tab is

0.6 (2018-03-04)
----------------

Features:

- Basic activity stream for listening and favorites (#23)
- Switched to django-channels and daphne for serving HTTP and websocket (#34)

Upgrades notes
**************

This version contains breaking changes in the way funkwhale is deployed,
please read the notes carefully.

Instance timeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new "Activity" page is now available from the sidebar, where you can
browse your instance activity. At the moment, this includes other users
favorites and listening, but more activity types will be implemented in the
future.

Internally, we implemented those events by following the Activity Stream
specification, which will help us to be compatible with other networks
in the long-term.

A new settings page has been added to control the visibility of your activity.
By default, your activity will be browsable by anyone on your instance,
but you can switch to a full private mode where nothing is shared.

The setting form is available in your profile.

Switch from gunicorn to daphne
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This release include an important change in the way we serve the HTTP API.
To prepare for new realtime features and enable websocket support in Funkwhale,
we are now using django-channels and daphne to serve HTTP and websocket traffic.

This replaces gunicorn and the switch should be easy assuming you
follow the upgrade process described bellow.

If you are using docker, please remove the command instruction inside the
api service, as the up-to-date command is now included directly in the image
as the default entry point:

.. code-block:: yaml

    api:
      restart: unless-stopped
      image: funkwhale/funkwhale:${FUNKWHALE_VERSION:-latest}
      command: ./compose/django/gunicorn.sh  # You can remove this line

On non docker setups, you'll have to update the [Service] block of your
funkwhale-server systemd unit file to launch the application server using daphne instead of gunicorn.

The new configuration should be similar to this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [Service]
    User=funkwhale
    # adapt this depending on the path of your funkwhale installation
    WorkingDirectory=/srv/funkwhale/api
    EnvironmentFile=/srv/funkwhale/config/.env
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/daphne -b ${FUNKWHALE_API_IP} -p ${FUNKWHALE_API_PORT} config.asgi:application

Ensure you update funkwhale's dependencies as usual to install the required
packages.

On both docker and non-docker setup, you'll also have to update your nginx
configuration for websocket support. Ensure you have the following blocks
included in your virtualhost file:

.. code-block:: txt

    map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        ''      close;
    }

    server {
        ...
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    }

Remember to reload your nginx server after the edit.

There is a brand new about page on instances (/about), and instance
owner can now provide a name, a short and a long description for their instance via the admin (/api/admin/dynamic_preferences/globalpreferencemodel/).

Transcoding:

Basic transcoding is now available to/from the following formats : ogg and mp3.

*This is still an alpha feature at the moment, please report any bug.*

This relies internally on FFMPEG and can put some load on your server.
It's definitely recommended you setup some caching for the transcoded files
at your webserver level. Check the the exemple nginx file at deploy/nginx.conf
for an implementation.

On the frontend, usage of transcoding should be transparent in the player.

Music Requests:

This release includes a new feature, music requests, which allows users
to request music they'd like to see imported.
