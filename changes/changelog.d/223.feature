Files management interface for users with "library" permission (#223)

Files management interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first bit of an ongoing work that will span several releases, to
bring more powerful library management features to Funkwhale. This iteration
includes a basic file management interface where users with the "library"
permission can list and search available files, order them using
various criterias (size, bitrate, duration...) and delete them.
