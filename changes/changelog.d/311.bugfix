Ensure radios can only be edited and deleted by their owners (#311)

Permission issues on radios
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Because of an error in the way we checked user permissions on radios,
public radios could be deleted by any logged-in user, even if they were not
the owner of the radio.

We recommend instances owners to upgrade as fast as possible to avoid any abuse
and data loss.
