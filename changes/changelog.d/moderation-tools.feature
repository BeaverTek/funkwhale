First set of instance level moderation tools (#580, !521)


Instance-level moderation tools
-------------------------------

This release includes a first set of moderation tools that will give more control
to admins about the way their instance federate with other instance and accounts on the network.
Using these tools, it's now possible to:

- Browse known accounts and domains, and associated data (storage size, software version, etc.)
- Purge data belonging to given accounts and domains
- Block or partially restrict interactions with any account or domain

All those features are usable using a brand new "moderation" permission, meaning
you can appoints one or nultiple moderators to help with this task.

I'd like to thank all Mastodon contributors, because some of the these tools are heavily
inspired from what's being done in Mastodon. Thank you so much!
