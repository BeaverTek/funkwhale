Added multiple warnings in the documentation that you should never
run makemigrations yourself (#291)


About the makemigrations warning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may sometimes get the following warning while applying migrations::

    "Your models have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied."

This is a warning, not an error, and it can be safely ignored.
Never run the ``makemigrations`` command yourself.
