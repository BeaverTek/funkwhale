Added documentation for optimizing Funkwhale and reduce its memory
footprint.

Changelog
^^^^^^^^^

For non-docker deployments, add ``--proxy-headers`` at the end of the ``daphne``
command in :file:`/etc/systemd/system/funkwhale-server.service`.

This will ensure the application receive the correct IP address from the client
and not the proxy's one.
