Complete redesign of the library home and playlist pages (#284)


Library home and playlist page overhaul
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library home page have been completely redesigned to include:

- other users activity (listenings, playlists and favorites)
- recently imported albums

We think this new version showcases more music in a more useful way, let us know
what you think about it!

The playlist page have been updated as well.
