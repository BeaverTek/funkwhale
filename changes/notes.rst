Artist hiding in the interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's now possible for users to hide artists they don't want to see.

Content linked to hidden artists will not show up in the interface anymore. Especially:

- Hidden artists tracks are removed from the current queue
- Starting a playlist will skip tracks from hidden artists
- Recently favorited, recently listened and recently added widgets on the homepage won't include content from hidden artists
- Radio suggestions will exclude tracks from hidden artists
- Hidden artists won't appear in Subsonic apps

Results linked to hidden artists will continue to show up in search results and their profile page remains accessible.
